    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This repository builds on the python package OSMNx (v.2.0.1, https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I recommend installing it via conda:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n ox -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority osmnx\n",
    "```\n",
    "For sampling nodes based on city names two additional packages are required, namely geopy (v.2.3.1, https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and overpy (v.0.7, https://python-overpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install geopy\n",
    "pip install overpy nodes run Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 LTS.\n",
    "There is local scratch space on each node, which is shared between the jobs currently running. Connected to Kebnekaise is also our parallel file system Ransarn (where your project storage is located), which provide quick access to files regardless of which node they run on. For more information about the different file systems that are available on our systems, read the Filesystems and Storage page.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualizing routes and geometry on maps I use the folium package (v.0.19.4, https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) that is included in the OSMNx package, but for creating static images of these visualizations the Selenium package is required (v.4.28.0, https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install selenium\n",
    "```\n",

    "## This exampleCities are used as the basis to find random samples of intersections. The region and country names are nice to have, but they are not necessary."
