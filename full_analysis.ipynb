    "This repository builds on the python package OSMNx (v.2.0.1, https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). I recommend installing it via conda:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n ox -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority osmnx\n",
    "```\n",
    "For sampling nodes based on city names two additional packages are required, namely geopy (v.2.3.1, https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and overpy (v.0.7, https://python-overpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install geopy\n",
    "pip install overpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualizing routes and geometry on maps I use the folium package (v.0.19.4, https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) that is included in the OSMNx package, but for creating static images of these visualizations the Selenium package is required (v.4.28.0, https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)\n",

    "## This example\n",
    "Cities are used as the basis to find random samples of intersections. The region and country names are nice to have, but they are not necessary."
